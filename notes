    * Messages for package dev-libs/boost-1.77.0-r4:

     * Boost.Regex is *extremely* ABI sensitive. If you get errors such as
      *
       *   undefined reference to `boost::re_detail_107700::cpp_regex_traits_implementation
        *     <char>::transform_primary[abi:cxx11](char const*, char const*) const'
         *
          * Then you need to recompile Boost and all its reverse dependencies
           * using the same toolchain. In general, *every* change of the C++ toolchain
            * requires a complete rebuild of the Boost-dependent ecosystem.
